# CTIS164 Projects

These are the projects that I made for my CTIS 164 Technical Mathematics with Programming course. \
You have to install FreeGlut in order to run the programs. \
All of the code is written in C language even though the file extensions are ".cpp". 

### Project 1 - Space View:

Pressing space pauses the UFO movement.

### Project 2 - Space Shooter:

You shoot the alien invaders by pressing space button while changing the cosmic bow's position with arrow keys. \
Aliens spawn randomly at the right half.
